\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
Three methods are presented for determining the gain $K$ and time constant $\tau$ of the first order linear model of a DC motor.
The angular velocity of the motor $\omega_m$ is related to the input voltage $u_m$ through the model.
An analytical derivation with approximate values for the physical elements of the motor yields poor results.
Using analysis of static conditions on the experiment motor yields an acceptable model that underestimates its velocity at higher input voltage.
The bump test, which measures the system's response to a unit step input, gives a highly accurate model with $K = \SI{18.8}{\radian\per\volt\per\second}$ and $\tau = \SI{0.091}{\second}$.
