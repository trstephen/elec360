\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We were able to complete the stacking task with angular and GUI entry modes but were unsuccessful with linear entry mode.
The difficulty with linear mode was the result of invalid joint positions demanded by the per-joint decomposition.
This naive method for solving this problem is to store more points, since errors arise from the composition of many movements.
A more optimal solution is to mirror the decomposition algorithm in point placement -- always start movements from the shoulder out to the gripper and create new points whenever you have to correct movement ``up'' the arm.
