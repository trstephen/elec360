\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
This experiment uses a Lab-Volt 5250 robotic arm (see Figure ~\ref{fig:arm}) to demonstrate the differences between angular, linear and GUI control modes.

Angular and GUI modes allow the user to control the position of each robot joint.
Linear mode moves the tip of the robot's gripper through a Cartesian plane and determines the specific joint movements needed to achieve this motion.
